# MultiAudioListener
This is a unity asset makes it possible to use multiple audio listeners in Unity.

With the default audio listener in Unity you can have only on ear in the scene. This means that the direction and volume of all sounds will be dependant on that one point.<p>
With this asset you can have multiple audio listeners/ears in the scene. This means you can hear all the sounds close to multiple points in the scene each with their own direction.
